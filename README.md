## Introduction
Dark Pattern Buster is a project aimed at identifying and mitigating dark patterns in user interfaces. Dark patterns are deceptive design tactics used in websites and apps to trick users into actions they might not otherwise take. This tool helps to expose such manipulative designs and promote better UX practices.

## Features
- **Automated Detection:** Scans websites for known dark patterns.
- **User Reports:** Allows users to report new dark patterns.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Visualizes data on detected dark patterns.
- **Educational Resources:** Provides information on how to avoid dark patterns in design.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Python
- **Frameworks:** Flask
- **Database:** SQLite, MongoDB
- **Payment Gateway:** Razorpay

The `server` folder contains the Node.js server for features like privacy policy check and user-reported dark patterns. The `api` folder contains the Python server that automatically detects dark patterns on websites.
